# Lumbar Spine MRI Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository documents my contribution as a Data Science Researcher with the **Data Science Society, University of Sydney (August 2024 â€“ October 2024)**.  
The project focused on applying deep learning methods to medical imaging, specifically improving the classification of lumbar spine conditions from MRI scans.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project was to investigate the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for medical image classification.  
The research aimed to support radiologists by developing an AI-based system capable of assisting in diagnostic decision-making.

Key aspects of the project include:
- Development of CNN architectures for MRI image classification.
- Application of computer vision techniques for preprocessing and augmentation.
- Early experimental results that indicated improvements in diagnostic accuracy.
- Integration of deep learning tools with standard medical imaging workflows.
